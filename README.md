# Basketball Scoreboard via vb.net

This is a Basketball Scoreboard with a Controller written in Visual Basic.net. Like a traditional scoreboard and controller, the controller enables the user to manage and control the primary display, add/subtract points, and more! Scores can be added (+1, +2, and +3) as well as subtracted (-1, -2, and -3). You may add and subtract how many fouls, blocks, and steals each team has. You may also modify the team names, stadium, and time!
