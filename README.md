This is a Basketball Scoreboard with a Controller, coded in Visual Basic.net. The controller allows the user to add/subtract points, manage and control the main display, just like a physical scoreboard & controller! You can add scores (+1, +2, and +3) and subtract scores (-1, -2, and -3). You have the ability to add and subtract how many fouls, blocks and steals each team has. Additionally, you can change the stadium and team names!
